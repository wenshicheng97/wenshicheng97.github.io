<!-- *Hello World!*

Shicheng Wen is currently a second-year master's student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). As a student research assistant at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/), he is privileged to be mentored by [Dr. Xuezhe Ma](https://xuezhemax.github.io/), focusing research on Natural Language Processing. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, obtained in 2020 from [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). 

Driven by a passion for creating human-centered AI tools, he is particularly intrigued by the capabilities of foundation models like GPT-4, Llama2, and PaLM. His research interests include:
- **Model Understanding and Accessibility**: Exploring methods to demystify these large models, striving to enhance smaller, open-source models to be competitive in generating controlled texts, and assessing the performance of language models in out-of-domain tasks.
- **Semantic Comprehension in Generative Models**: Investigating how generative large language models can grasp the underlying meanings in human texts, with a focus on enhancing dialogue systems for more socially aware communication.
- **Human-AI Interactions**: Seeking ways to improve human-AI interactions in the era of large language models. This includes leveraging these models for social good, such as developing emotional support agents, educational tools, and mental health counseling applications.

Shicheng believes that the future of AI lies in its ability to understand and augment human capabilities, making technology a more empathetic and effective partner in addressing complex societal challenges. -->
