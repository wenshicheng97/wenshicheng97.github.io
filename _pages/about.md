Hello World! 

Shicheng Wen is a second year master's at [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) of [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). He is a student research assistant working in [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/), he has the honor be advised by [Dr. Xuezhe Ma](https://xuezhemax.github.io/), focusing in Natural Language Processing. Previously, he received his Bachelor's degree (2020) of Computer Science and Mathematics from [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). Shicheng is passionate about building human-centered AI tools. As he is fascinated by the potential of pre-trained large language models (GPT4, Llama2), he is interested in studying the following aspects:
 - How can we understand how these models work?
 - How to make the models understand the underlying meanings behind human texts? 
 - How can we make smaller open-sourced models be competable large language models, such that they can generate controllable texts?
